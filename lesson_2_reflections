What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Well i do not know, a .git file is created and the folder becomes a got repo.
I need to use the "git init" command

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area =/= working directory 
Staging area =/= repository


It offers an intermediate stage with less commitment so you can still manage some changes
